-Interface proxy (convert (weave) interface to class?!)
--> Interface which inherits other interfaces
--> Interface which inherits from generic interface and specifies the generic parameters
--> Interface which inherits from generic interface and does not specify generic parameters
--> Interface which inherits from generic interface and specifies some generic parameters

-Remove [StaticProxy] attribute from types after weaving.

-test that params[] parameters works

-have one unit tests which fails when PEVerify was not run (PEVerify.exe cannot be found)

-instead of throwing an exception when [StaticProxy] is not yet used in the solution, stop weaving and output a warning instead? Like: you are currently not use any static proxy, begin by putting [StaticProxy] on a class!

- Check whether proxied class implements IDisposable, if so, call dispose on IDynamicInterceptorManager
--> handle cases where interceptor is IDispoable but proxied class is not! how? throw exception?
